This repository will contain all libraries I write for the Arduino.
In order to include these libraries into your Arduino IDE, just download the particular library you want as a .zip file, extract it, and then copy the folder into your /Documents/Arduino/libraries folder.

If there are any extra steps needed to make a certain library work, then I will include a README file inside that particular library.

These libraries use a GPT 3.0 license, so you're free to use/modify them however you wish as long as you give me a mention in your project/code.
